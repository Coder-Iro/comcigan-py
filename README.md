Comcigan-py is a parser for korean school timetable service ["comcigan"](http://컴시간학생.kr) made with python.
## Installation
Install and update using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/):
```sh
$ pip install comcigan
```
## Example
A simple example for sync/async version
```python
from comcigan import School, AsyncSchool

myschool = School("schoolname")
myschool = await AsyncSchool.init("schoolname")  # or this for async version
# "schoolname" doesn't have to be the full name of the school.
# comcigan-py automatically recognizes "schoolname" as a search query.
# If there is only one school searched, an instance of that school is created.
# If there are more than two schools searched, ValueError is raised.
# If there is no school searched, NameError is raised.

print(myschool.name)  # This prints the school's name
# The result may not be the same as "schoolname".

print(myschool[2][3][3][3])
# This returns Thursday 3rd period in the 2nd grade 3rd class.
```
